      "Code-Companion is a web app that allows users to team up with people around the world to work on coding projects and share their experience. This app allows you to post projects you are looking for partners on or join projects other users have posted. When a project is posted the creator enters a description, specifies which language/stack they are working with, lists any additional technologies being used on project, adds a GibHub repo link, and posts either a slack channel or some other way to contact them. This allows users to filter by programming language to find something that best suits their skillset.  User's can also build a custom profile which lets them list all of their relevant skills, accomplishments, and years/months of experience.",
